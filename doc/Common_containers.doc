\section desc Description
Commonly used persistent containers.

\subsection interface Public interface
- edm::EDCollection <b>&lt;T&gt;</b>: Functionally equivalent to <tt>std::vector&lt;T&gt;</tt>. 
  Still present for hystorical reason; will be probably removed in one of the next releases.

- edm::DetSet <b>&lt;T&gt;</b>:

- edm::ExtCollection <b>&lt;C, Ext&gt;</b>:a collection providing 
  internally as instance of a collection of type 
  <tt><b>C</b></tt> plus an intsance of the type <tt><b>Ext</b></tt> 
  specified as template parameter. The class provides the same interface of 
  <tt>std::vector&lt;C&gt;</tt> plus the methods:
\htmlonly
<pre>
  Ext & ext() { return ext_; }
  const Ext & ext() const { return ext_; }
</pre>
\endhtmlonly
that allow to access, and possibly modify, the instance <tt><b>ext_</b></tt> of the 
type <tt><b>Ext</b></tt>.

- edm::IDVectorMap <b>&lt;ID, C, P&gt;</b>:

- edm::AssociationMap <b>&lt;CKey, CVal, Tag, index &gt;</b>: one-to-many
  association based on edm::Ref, of objects in a <tt>CKey</tt> collection 
  to one or many objects in a collection <tt>CVal</tt>. Stored indices are of type 
  <tt>index</tt>, that is by default <tt>unsigned long</tt>, but could be
  <tt>unsigned short</tt> for collections with less than 65535 objects.
  The template <tt>Tag</tt> should be either edm::OneToOne for
  one-to-one maps, or edm::OneToMany for one-to-many maps.

- edm::OwnVector <b>&lt;T, P = edm::ClonePolicy&lt;T&gt; &gt;</b>: container 
  with interface very similar to <tt>std::vector&lt;T&gt;</tt>, but 
  capable of storing polymorphic objects that are owned by the 
  container to avoid memory leak. Has functionalities similar to 
  <tt>boost::ptr_vector&lt;T&gt;</tt>, but also provides EDM persistent 
  capabilities. 
  <br><br>The first template argument <tt><b>T</b></tt> is the common base class of
  polymorphic objects to be stored; the second parameter <tt><b>P</b></TT> specifies
  the  \ref DataFormats_Common_helpers "policy" required to allocate clones of 
  the stored object. By default, it
  is equal to the type <b>edm::ClonePolicy&lt;T&gt;</b>, which assumes that the 
  type <tt>T</tt> is equipped with a virtual method <tt><b>clone()</b></tt> that returns a cloned
  instance of the actual concrete object. Other user-provided policy implementations are possible.
  <br><br>Due to the polymorphic nature of contained objects, the STL <tt><b>std::sort</b></tt>
  functions do not work with edm::OwnVector. For this reason, functions to sort
  the collection are provided as class methods.

- edm::RangeMap <b>&lt;ID, C, P&gt;</b>: generic container of objects
  organized in a collection of type <tt><b>C</b></tt> and sorted 
  according to an identified of type <tt><b>ID</b></tt>. It is
  possible to iterate over contained object, iterate over identifiers,
  access only objects with a specified identifier, or whose identifier
  match a specified criterion. The collection is sorted before being
  inserted in the Event. The  \ref DataFormats_Common_helpers "policy" to be used
  to produce copies/clones of the objects during insertion and final
  sorting phases can be specified as template parameter <tt><b>P</b></tt>.

- edm::SortedCollection <b>&lt;T, SORT&gt;</b>:

\subsection modules Modules
None.
